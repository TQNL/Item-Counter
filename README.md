# Item-Counter
With this data pack, you can count dropped items in 2 ways:

### 1

You can name an armor stand 'itemcount<radius>', where radius is the radius around the armor stand where the data pack will try to find items (for example: itemcount12). Clear indicators will be given to signify a recognised item counter.

### 2

Doing '/trigger global_item_counter' and then clicking 'On' will make the data pack ignore the item counters and count all loaded items.

Bundles, shulker boxes and other items containing items have their contends extracted after counting them. '/trigger item_count_sidebar' can be used to view the counted items in the world. '/trigger reset_count' to reset the counted items. This goes without saying: Items that have been counted aren't counted again. This data pack does need some operator permissions for triggers, so it doesn't work well on servers.
